Human languages across the world have a wide range of variations in their grammatical properties. But, is there any limit to such variations? Do languages share any significant common properties? The search for properties holding across languages, or *language universals*, is a fundamental goal in linguistics, as it offers a window into our shared linguistic ability as a human kind.

Meanings of single words, or *lexical semantics*, is one area in which the research on language universals has been highly successful. Although, at first glance, words in different languages appear to express unlimited varieties of meanings, linguistic research has revealed robust similarities in lexical semantics across languages (Barwise & Cooper 1981). However, the current literature is crucially limited in its empirical scope; it is largely restricted to quantifiers and logical connectives. 

This collaboration extends the research on lexical-semantic universals into an uncultivated domain: *modal words*. These words include modal auxiliaries (e.g., *may*/*must*), attitudinal verbs (*believe*/*know*). Although these items have been extensively studied in particular languages, cross-linguistic universals concerning their meanings have been rarely investigated, due to the scarcity of theoretical frameworks that enable feasible universal constraints capturing their semantic intricacies.

Recent semantic theories of *question sentences* suggest that the semantic behavior of modal words in questions is a key to discovering cross-linguistic universals about modal lexical semantics. For example, Spector & Egr√© (2015) speculate that no human language attitudinal verb expresses knowledge when it takes a proposition while expressing ignorance when it takes a question. Recently, several similar non-trivial language-universals concerning modal words have been suggested in the literature (Theiler, Roelofsen and Aloni 2018).

To evaluate these theoretical proposals, it is crucial to systematically test them with a wide range of cross-linguistic data. In this project, we will entertain and evaluate hypotheses about modal lexical-semantic universals in view of language samples including Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Ngamo, Romanian, Turkish, and Zapotec. At the same time, we will investigate the theoretical underpinning of feasible semantic universals for modal meanings. In particular, we will consider how different semantic models of propositions and questions differentiate the space of possible modal meanings.
