Welcome to the webpage of the NWO collaboration project "ModUni: Searching for semantic universals in the modal domain" (2018-2021; NWO-IG.18.023). 
<!-- This page contains general information about the project as well as details about the four workshops. The output of the project will be uploaded as they become available.  -->

## What is the ModUni project?

Human languages across the world have a wide range of variations in their grammatical properties. But, is there any limit to such variations? Do languages share any significant common properties? The search for properties holding across languages, or *language universals*, is a fundamental goal in linguistics, as it offers a window into our shared linguistic ability as a human kind.

Meanings of single words, or *lexical semantics*, is one area in which the research on language universals has been highly successful. Although, at first glance, words in different languages appear to express unlimited varieties of meanings, linguistic research has revealed robust similarities in lexical semantics across languages (Barwise & Cooper 1981, Keenan & Stavi 1986). 

This collaboration extends the research on lexical-semantic universals into a less cultivated domain: *modal words*. These words include modal auxiliaries (e.g., *may*/*must*), attitudinal verbs (e.g., *believe*/*know*) and evidential particles (e.g., *yooda*/*darou* in Japanese). The collaboration will entertain and evaluate hypotheses about modal lexical-semantic universals in view of language samples including Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Ngamo, Romanian, Turkish, and Zapotec. At the same time, we will investigate the theoretical underpinning of feasible semantic universals for modal meanings.
