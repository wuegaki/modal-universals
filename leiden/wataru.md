## Title

Project Introduction + Constraints on the lexical semantics of question-embedding predicates

## Abstract

In recent years, several authors have argued that responsive predicates---the
clause-embedding predicates that can embed either a declarative or
interrogative complement---semantically select for questions rather than
propositions, based on a number of empirical observations, e.g., false-answer
sensitivity of factive predicates (Theiler 2014, Theiler, Roelofsen & Aloni
2018; cf. George 2011), interpretation of nominal complements (Uegaki 2016),
behavior of Predicates of Relevance (Elliott, Klinedinst, Sudo & Uegaki
2017), and the interpretation of the Estonian verb *mõtlema* (Roberts 2018).

However, there is also a possibility that the question-oriented semantics for
responsive predicates is too powerful, i.e., too unrestricted. That is, by
itself, the theory allows us to define a cross-linguistically non-existent
predicate. As a candidate for such a non-existent predicate, Spector and Egré
(2015) discuss a fictitious predicate \*_shknow_, which means 'know' when it
embeds a declarative clause but means 'wonder' when it embeds an interrogative
clause.

In this talk, based on proposals in the recent literature (Theiler et al.
2018; Uegaki 2018), I will discuss possible ways to constrain the
question-oriented semantics for responsive predicates so that a non-existing
predicate like \*_shknow_ can be ruled out, without abandoning the empirical
advantage of the theory. These constraints constitute possible working
hypotheses for the lexical-semantic universals in the domain of responsive 
predicates. 

In the beginning of the talk, I will also introduce the general
agenda of the ModUni project.
