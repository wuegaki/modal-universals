## Title

Issues in Modal Force: The View from Finnish

## Abstract

In this talk, I discuss the lexical semantics of modal auxiliaries in Finnish,
focusing on the deontic. A growing body of research on variable-force modality
has greatly widened our understanding of how modal domains may be shaped
(Kratzer 2012; Rullmann et al. 2008; Deal 2011). Modal force is widely divided
into two categories, strong and weak; von Fintel and Iatridou (2008) propose
that weak necessity modals employ a secondary ordering source, which imposes
domain restriction and results in logical weakening. In Finnish, diagnostics
for weak necessity break down to some extent and pose problems for existing
theoretical accounts. For instance, speakers report clear intuitions regarding
the strength relationship between two necessity modals, placing *t채yty채* as
stronger than *pit채채*. Furthermore, conditional-mood marking is licit on modals,
where it has a weakening effect akin to that ascribed to counterfactual
marking triggering a weak necessity interpretation cross-linguistically
(ibid.). The following research questions will be addressed: i) How does the
Finnish modal system fit into the typology of modal force?  ii) What is the
contribution of conditional marking to the interpretation of Finnish deontics?
iii) Does Finnish support a (strictly) domain-restriction based account
distinguishing between strong and weak necessity? What does this tell us about
modal scales more generally?
