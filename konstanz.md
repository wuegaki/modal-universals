## Practical details

* **Date**: 9-11 October, 2019
* **Venue**: University of Konstanz

## 

The workshop consists of public talks as well as an internal meeting 
where project members discuss the progress on the following three subprojects:
  1. **Strategies to express epistemic stance**
     - What kind of lexical and grammatical markings (e.g., modal auxiliaries, tense) are used to express an epistemic stance?
     - What is the exact semantic implication of the marking? How is it compared to epistemic possibility, necessity, weak necessity and likelihood modal etc.
     - subproject lead: Malte Zimmermann
  2. **Attitudes and Selection:** 
     - Are there cross-linguistic universals in the possible combinations of semantic properties within attitudinal predicates? 
     - Are there cross-linguistic tendencies in the correlation between semantic properties of attitudinal predicates and their selectional restrictions? 
     - subproject lead: Floris Roelofsen + Wataru Uegaki
  3. **Mood and tense marking in the embedded context** 
     - What are the conditions that license indicative and subjunctive mood in the embedded context cross-linguistically? 
     - What are the conditions that govern the tense marking in the embedded context? 
     - subproject lead: Maribel Romero
