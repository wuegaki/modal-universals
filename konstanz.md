## Practical details

* **Date**: 9-11 October, 2019
* **Venue**: University of Konstanz

## 

The workshop consists of public talks as well as an internal meeting 
where project members discuss the progress on the following three subprojects:
  1. **Epistemics: strategies to express epistemic stance**
     - What kind of lexical and grammatical markings (e.g., modal auxiliaries, tense) are used to express an epistemic stance?
     - What is the exact semantic implication of the marking? How is it compared to epistemic possibility, necessity, weak necessity and likelihood modal etc.
    - subproject lead: Malte Zimmermann
  - cross-linguistic universals in the possible combinations of semantic properties in attitudinal predicates, and their relation to selectional restrictions (lead: Floris Roelofsen + Wataru Uegaki)
  - cross-linguistic universals and variation in the licensing conditions for tense and mood marking in embedded context (lead: Maribel Romero)
