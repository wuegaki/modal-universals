## Title

Ease of learning explains semantic universals

## Abstract

Despite extraordinary differences between natural languages, linguists have
identified many semantic universals – shared properties of meaning – that are
yet to receive a unified explanation. We analyze universals in a domain of
content words (color terms) and a domain of function words (quantifiers).
Using tools from machine learning, we show that meanings satisfying attested
universals are easier to learn than those that are not. Thus, ease of learning
can explain the presence of semantic universals in many different linguistic
domains.
